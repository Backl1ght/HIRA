# LOLCPC

Library for Competitive Programming Contest Online.

Most competitive programming contest only support submitting single file, this can not taking advantage of libraries. As a result of this, I maintained a copy-paste code template with redundant code everywhere, and wrote large sources files every time I compete. This is really annoying for me.

But one day I found out that I can take adcantage of preprocessing phase of compiler. That is, write solution taking advantage of libraries, preprocess the solution and then get a single source file for submission.

## Preference

- Platform: Linux.
- Editor: Visual Studio Code.
- Cpp Standard: c++17.
- Contest: Codeforces, AtCoder, etc.
- Local Validation: `Visual Studio Code - Competitive Programming Helper`.
- Local Debugging: `Visual Studio Code - Code Runner`.
- Coding Style: Google, Chromium.

## Dependencies

For unittest, it is based on gtest. Except unittest, there is no dependencies.

## Usage

### For Local Validation

TBD.

### For Local Debugging

TBD.

### For Submission
